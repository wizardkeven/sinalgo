--  WALKER  --

  a very simple example
  a random walk with one walker:
    there is only one message in the network
    this message is emitted by a (single) initiator (called InitNode)
    it is transmitted through the network 
       the next node is chosen at random uniformly among the neighbors
       (we call this function randomChoice)
    ... until it reaches its destination: the EndNode which stops it.
    
 Algorithm: (the message is called "the walker")

    1: if InitNode then
    2:     send the walker to next = randomChoice

	3: forever
    4:     receive the walker from some node N
    4:     if EndNode then
    5:         do nothing! 
    6:     else
    7:         send the walker to next = randomChoice
